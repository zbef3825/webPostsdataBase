# PWWT database server

## Usage
calm-springs-9697.herokuapp.com

## API Instruction

```javascript
{
     "userID": [userID Name], 
     "password":[password]
}
```
## *LOGIN*
1. Make a POST request through "calm-springs-9697.herokuapp.com/login"
<p>Make sure Content-Type is application/json.</p>
<p>Make sure 'userID' and 'password' fields is not blank.</p>
<p>Note that userID and passwords are case sensitive.</p>

2. If userID and password are valid, you will receive a token. Token will expire when user logs out.
<p>*If you are scrapy, you will receive 60 seconds to upload your data. Once the token is expired you will have to go through login process again.</p>

## *GET & POST*
1. You may now use a token as Header to make GET and POST requests throughout the server
<p>Your Headers should contain "Content-Type" as "application/json" and "Authorization" as "Bearer Token"</p>

*To see all the web posts:
<p>GET '/api/all'</p>

*To see web posts of different category
<p>GET '/api/:category'</p>

*To see web posts of different category on specific date (YYYYMMDD)
<p>GET '/api/:category/:date'</p>

*To download all web posts in CSV file
<p>GET '/api/download'</p>

*To upload webpost of category
<p>POST '/api/save/:category'</p>


2. If you are scrapy and want to upload data, use following JSON schema:
```javascript
var dataAttributes = new Schema({
        scrapyName : String,
		postTitle : String,
		postUpvote : Number,
		postLink : String,
		commentLink : String,
		rankingPosition : String
});
```
<p>All the attibutes must be included in JSON format as the server checks for the json validation</p>
<p>If you are uploading one web post at a time, make sure to send following JSON before AND after transmission:</p>

<p>Before:</p>
```javascript
{
    "start": true,
    "scrapyName": [name]
}
```
<p>After:</p>
```javascript
{
    "end": true,
    "scrapyName": [name]
}
```
<p>If you are uploading data in array, you do not need to send before and after</p>
```javascript
[
    {
        "scrapyName" : [Name],
		"postTitle" : [Title],
		"postUpvote" : [Upvote],
		"postLink" : [linkaddress],
		"commentLink" : [linkaddress],
		"rankingPosition" : [Ranking]
    },
    {
        "scrapyName" : [Name],
		"postTitle" : [Title],
		"postUpvote" : [Upvote],
		"postLink" : [linkaddress],
		"commentLink" : [linkaddress],
		"rankingPosition" : [Ranking]
    }
]

```

<p>When a scrapy performing POST request, other scrapys cannot interfere with POST operation. Please make sure your scrapy is timed.</p>
